# Winter World Cup

FIFA World Cup 2022 is just months away and all of us fans of the beautiful game couldn't be more excited! 

To celebrate the upcoming first ever Winter World Cup, I think it's appropriate to create a simple application through Python that users can tinker with to obtain information about the quadrennial tournament. Moreover, they can also take part in a simple trivia quiz that tests their knowledge of the World Cup.

The creation of this application is intended to showcase the application of Python in a real-world context. 
Heroku is used to deploy the application on a webpage.
